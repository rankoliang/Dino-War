**How to Play?**

<p>The player will use the dinosaur legend on each side of the battlefield to understand the point value of a specific dinosaur.
We encourage the player to group like dinosaurs together when adding up the totals. Using your imagination with addition or multiplication will make adding their values easier.</p>
   
Be careful! The game will add in subtraction dinosaurs as the difficulty increases.
   
<p>The player will adjust the input field to equal each team's total point value.
   Once you are certain of your answer, click Battle!</p>

**How is the score calculated?**

Once the user starts the battle, the game will count each dinosaur's value starting with the red team.
The computer will place each team's total value in the actual count container.
If at least one of your answers is equal to the actual count value, you will be allowed to proceed to the next level.
A perfect game will consist of two correct answers awarding you a badge!
You can view your earned badge on the level select screen. ~To be implemetned
